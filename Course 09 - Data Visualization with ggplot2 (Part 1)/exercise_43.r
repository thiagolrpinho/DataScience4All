# EXERCISE
# Titanic
# You've watched the movie Titanic by James Cameron (1997) again and after a good portion of sobbing you decide to investigate whether you'd have a chance of surviving this disaster.

# To start your investigation, you decide to do some exploratory visualization with ggplot(). You have information on who survived the sinking given their age, sex and passenger class.

# INSTRUCTIONS

# 1 - Have a look at the str() of the titanic dataset, which has been loaded into your workspace. Looks like the data is pretty tidy!
# 2 - Plot the distribution of sexes within the classes of the ship.
# Use ggplot() with the data layer set to titanic.
# Map Pclass onto the x axis, Sex onto fill and draw a dodged bar plot using geom_bar(), i.e. set the geom position to "dodge".
# 3 - These bar plots won't help you estimate your chances of survival. Copy the previous bar plot, but this time add a facet_grid() layer: . ~ Survived.
# 4 - We've defined a position object for you.
# 5 - Include Age, the final variable.
# Take plot 3 and add a mapping of Age onto the y aesthetic.
# Change geom_bar() to geom_point() and set its attributes size = 3, alpha = 0.5 and position = posn.jd.
# Make sure that Sex is mapped onto color instead of fill to correctly color the scatter plots. (This was discussed in detail here and here).

# 1 - Check the structure of titanic
str(titanic)

# 2 - Use ggplot() for the first instruction
ggplot(titanic, aes(x = Pclass, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")

# 3 - Plot 2, add facet_grid() layer
ggplot(titanic, aes(x = Pclass, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  facet_grid(.~ Survived)
  
# 4 - Define an object for position jitterdodge, to use below
posn.jd <- position_jitterdodge(0.5, 0, 0.6)

# 5 - Plot 3, but use the position object from instruction 4
ggplot(titanic, aes(x = Pclass, y = Age, col = Sex)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5, position = posn.jd) +
  facet_grid(.~ Survived)
