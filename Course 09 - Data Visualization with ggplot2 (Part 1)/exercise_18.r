# EXERCISE
# All about attributes, part 1
# In the video you saw that you can use all the aesthetics as attributes. Let's see how this works with the aesthetics you used in the previous exercises: x, y, color, fill, size, alpha, label and shape.

# This time you'll use these arguments to set attributes of the plot, not aesthetics. However, there are some pitfalls you'll have to watch out for: these attributes can overwrite the aesthetics of your plot!

# A word about shapes: In the exercise "All about aesthetics, part 2", you saw that shape = 21 results in a point that has a fill and an outline. Shapes in R can have a value from 1-25. Shapes 1-20 can only accept a color aesthetic, but shapes 21-25 have both a color and a fill aesthetic. See the pch argument in par() for further discussion.

# A word about hexadecimal colours: Hexadecimal, literally "related to 16", is a base-16 alphanumeric counting system. Individual values come from the ranges 0-9 and A-F. This means there are 256 possible two-digit values (i.e. 00 - FF). Hexadecimal colours use this system to specify a six-digit code for Red, Green and Blue values ("#RRGGBB") of a colour (i.e. Pure blue: "#0000FF", black: "#000000", white: "#FFFFFF"). R can accept hex codes as valid colours.

# 1 - You will continue to work with mtcars. Use ggplot() to create a basic scatter plot: map wt onto x, mpg onto y and cyl onto color.
# 2 - Overwrite the color of the points inside geom_point() to my_color. Notice how this cancels out the colors given to the points by the number of cylinders!
# 3 - Starting with plot 2, map cyl to fill instead of col and set the attributes size to 10, shape to 23 and color to my_color inside geom_point().

# Define a hexadecimal color
my_color <- "#4ABEFF"

# Draw a scatter plot with color *aesthetic*
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, col = cyl) ) + 
geom_point()


# Same, but set color *attribute* in geom layer 
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, col = cyl) ) + 
geom_point(color = my_color)



# Set the fill aesthetic; color, size and shape attributes
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, fill = cyl) ) + 
geom_point(color = my_color, size = 10, shape = 23)


# Hunky-dory hex specs! Notice that if an aesthetic and an attribute are set with the same argument, the attribute takes precedence. Once again, you see that the attribute needs to match the shape and geom, the fill aesthetic (or attribute) will only work with certain shapes.
